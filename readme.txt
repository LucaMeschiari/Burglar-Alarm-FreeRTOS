This fourth state is called in this project Pre-Alarm state.The activation and the deactivation of the system, since there is only the fully armed option, is done entering a for digits code code. (The code used is 1-2-3-4).The touch screen lcd display offers a graphical interface to the user communicating the state of the system also informing the user on the amount of time remaining if the sensor 1 is triggered (in the armed state) before switching to the alarm state. it also show a virtual numeric keyboard which can be used to enter the code to manage the system, the code inserted is shown on the screen and in case a wrong code is typed an error message appears on the screen to notify the user.The LEDs will show the sensors who has detected the effraction (only when the system is in Alarm state) and also if another sensor is triggered its corresponding LED would be turned on. Thanks to that the user can have a full overview of the state of the system.Check readme.pdf for the complete documentation.
